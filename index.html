    <p> The first Monster Hunter game was one of three titles<em> Capcom had</em> developed to take advantage
                of the processing power and online capabilities of the PlayStation 2, which according to Ryozo
                Tsujimoto, who has been the series' producer since Monster Hunter Freedom 2, had begun to match
                arcade games in capabilities; the other two such titles were Auto Modellista and Resident Evil
                Outbreak.[9] Tsujimoto considered Monster Hunter to be the culmination of the work of these other
                two titles once it was released.[9] He also felt that the game was intended for such cooperative
                play so that players of any skill level, working with others, could feel accomplished in taking down
                giant creatures.[10] Monster Hunter proved a success, selling over 1 million copies, principally in
                Japan.[10] Enhanced versions of the early games, adding more difficult monsters and end-game quests,
                were released with a "G" affixed to the end (such as Monster Hunter G for the first such game); for
                those titles that were released in Western regions, these were often, though not always, affixed with
                the Ultimate moniker. A second team worked to develop a series for the PlayStation Portable.

                <h2 id="hunters">first release and gameplay</h2>
            <p> Monster Hunter is a Japanese media franchise centered around a series of fantasy-themed acti
                on role-playing video games that started with the game

            <h2>impact in japan</h2>
            <p> The series took off explosively in Japan with Monster Hunter G and Monster
                Hunter Portable/Freedom on the PlayStation Portable and even more so once
                its sequels Monster Hunter Dos, Monster Hunter Portable 2nd/Freedom 2 and
                Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G/Freedom Unite were released which supported
                up to four players.

        [11] Handheld systems are generally more popular in
                Japan and due to the country's high population density, it was easy to find
                players to hunt cooperatively with, making it a phenomenon there.[12] James
                Miekle, writing for PC Gamer, had worked for Q Entertainment and lived in Japan
                during the release of Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, which was the best selling
                PlayStation Portable game of all time and described how even during work, impromptu
                Monster Hunter sessions would break out between employees and there was extensive
                marketing of Monster Hunter branded consumer goods.[11]</p>

<blockquote><h2> anjanath</h2>
   the anjanath is monster hunters T rex witch means that its a powerfull monster with giant teeth.
the anjanath is a giant compared to some of the other monsters but it can be easy to nock down do to its
small arms this however does not make this an easy monster to take down and should only be done by
    a team of 2 or more hunters however it can be beaten by a more experienced player.
</blockquote>
<blockquote> <h3>rathalos.</h3> the rathalos is the basic dragon type monster that shows up
    in almost every game. the rathalos is very simalare to normal dragons except for the fact that its also
    poisonous
</blockquote>
      <blockquote><h2> nergigante</h2>
            the nergigante is the strongest monster in monster hunter. its armor is strong enough to block bullets
        and its strong enough to sometimes take 50 minutes to beat even with a 4 player party.
        its one of the strongest hitters the game witch means that it can sometimes defeat you in 1 hit
        witch combined with its hard armor and fast speed make it one of the hardest end game monsters to beat
        even beating out both the anjanath and rathalos.
            </blockquote>
